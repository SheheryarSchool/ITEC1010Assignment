    <p class="introtext">Hello, thank you for visiting my public website! My name is Sheheryar Qureshi, I am 19 years
      old and I am almost
      finished with my
      final semester for my first year of university. I go to York University for the Information Technology program,
      however I am switching to Computer Science for my second year. I am very passionate about technology as I have
      been running my own business in the technology field for almost five years now. I am knowledgeable of computer
      systems and software programs, I hope to expand on my knowledge and skillset quick so I can get started on bigger
      projects!</p>

      <p>Once upon a time, at the age of nine years, I attempted to download classic mario games onto my family laptop,
        unfortunately at that age I was not introduced to the world of emulation, so I accidentally installed a virus.
        This was not the first time it has happened, my father was very upset. Instead of paying to get it
        repaired, he paid the technician he's known for about five years at that time, to teach me to repair it myself.
        Looking back at that, my father was
        very smart for that because he no longer had to pay to get computer repairs. Today, I am the technician in the
        family. I learned how to install a fresh
        copy of Windows onto the laptop and then I managed to do it myself moving forward. From just that very simple
        installation, I fell in love with computers and that has led me to enjoying all the work I do in the computer
        field today. At the age of ten or eleven, I had also made my way into the mobile phone industry. I had started
        jailbreaking and rooting my devices which gave me so much knowledge on software and modifications generally. My
        parents also put me in coding camp during my elementary years, however I was more invested in software and
        hardware at the time. I built my first gaming computer at age twelve or thirteen, I remember it like it was
        yesterday, I went for an AMD Phenom II processor with 8GB RAM, 500GB SSD and the RX460 4GB graphics
        card. Looking back, the parts were not the best but at that time it kept me happy. With knowing hardware,
        software and modifications, I was able to open my business publicly in the summer of 2019.

      <p style="text-indent:50px;">My business is represented in the first picture with the three iPhone 12s. I offer
        mobile phones and related services.
        There are two aspects to my business: public deals and business-to-business deals. In addition to selling my
        phones to
        phone shops across Canada, I also operate a home-based business out of commercial space beneath my residence. It
        is my
        duty to provide customers with an excellent experience when they buy electronics below retail value. I offer a
        wide
        range of phone cases, including personalized ones. In addition, I offer screen covers and many computer and
        phone
        accessories. I love this business because I entered it very young and I am very knowledgeable of it which gave
        me
        the
        opportunity to support myself independently.</p>
      <p style="text-indent:50px">There are hundreds of computers at my disposal. It wouldn't hurt to put in a small bit
        of effort to market things; that
        way, I'm visible in my community and continue to attract customers. I truly appreciate what I do, and I found
        that
        adding this to my business was enjoyable. I repair technology. I would have to purchase the components, just
        connect
        them in, and install the newest version of Windows for the client. It was easy to upgrade hardware or fix
        damaged
        portions in terms of parts. Customers have occasionally asked me to install the Android TV operating system or a
        customized build of Linux for their own use, such as a private operating system or gaming platform. Working on
        those
        projects had not only increased my knowledge of technology but also of human beings.
      </p>
      <p style="text-indent:50px">Electronic repairs are one of the services I offer at my business. In addition to all
        PCs, laptops, tablets, phones, and
        smartwatches, I also fix selected TVs. I spent some time working in the phone industry's sales division, but I
        began
        working as a technician in grade nine. My parents paid for my tools, electronic devices, and parts so that I
        could
        gain
        experience working as a technician. I went public and offered this service at the beginning of the summer before
        grade
        ten, having practiced for over a year. I am skilled in fixing the screens, bodies, batteries, cameras, sensors,
        and flex
        wires of the devices. I am currently working in private in the field of microsoldering, and in a few months, I
        will be
        able to use my skills in public as well. Meeting different people is one of the reasons I love what I do. Many
        customers
        mention that Apple was unable to repair their devices and that they were offered a high price to replace or
        upgrade. It
        is great to see the smiles on people's faces after they tell me it was not repairable.

      <p style="text-indent:50px">One of the biggest electronics retailers in North America was supported by the
        electronics distribution company where I
        was employed. As a repair technician, I handled all repairs, including replacing screens, batteries, bodies,
        speakers,
        cameras, and flex cables. The three other technicians and I had a really laid-back and pleasant work atmosphere.
        Even
        though my profession kept me busy all day, I found that small moments spent with my peers were quite meaningful.
        Every
        day, I would receive between thirty and sixty phones that needed to be fixed. It was challenging at first, and I
        was
        only able to fix ten to fifteen phones every day. Eventually, though, I mastered the art of working quickly.
        Every day,
        I would receive new models of phones, like iPhones, Samsung and Google phones. Since I turned seventeen that
        summer, I
        was the youngest employee at the company while the other workers in other divisions were in their mid-twenties
        and the
        technicians were in their late twenties to early thirties. Being the youngest employee in the technician
        department was
        a bonus since, even though the work was much harder than sales, packaging, or cleaning, once I got the hang of
        it, it
        was also very rewarding. Looking back on my time there, I realized that while I gained more experience, I also
        gained
        confidence in my ability to manage my own business because I have been putting myself in position.</p>

      <p style="text-indent:50px">For around half a year, I was a sales representative for a financial technology
        banking company. In addition to offering
        standard banking services, the company launched a new local business network to drive business traffic and
        increase
        cashback for clients. Before I could speak with consumers, I had to first familiarize myself with their services
        so that
        I could be the expert in the discussion and genuinely believe in the services they offer. I now have knowledge
        about
        banking services, including credit, which has helped me manage my credit because I now know this. Customers can
        use
        their banking cards to make purchases and receive rewards at the same time thanks to connections this company
        has with
        other businesses. Working in my business for a while has equipped me with the abilities to close deals with
        customers,
        which has helped me throughout this time in my career. I had a terrific time working with customers and my
        coworkers in
        a great work atmosphere. My time at the financial technology banking organization was generally rewarding on
        both a
        personal and professional level. It enhanced my skills, broadened my knowledge, and provided me with the
        opportunity to
        have a major impact on both the client satisfaction and the company's success in the area I worked in.
